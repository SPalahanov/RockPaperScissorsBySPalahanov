# The "Rock - Paper - Scissors" Game by SPalahanov

A console-based C# implementation of the "Rock - Paper - Scissors" game.

Rock - Paper - Scissors is a simple two player game, where you and your oponent (the computer) simultaneously chose one of the following three options: "rock", "paper", "scissors".

# Input:
   - "rock" or "r"
   - "paper" or "p"
   - "scissors" or "s"

# Output:
   - The computer chooses a random option, then reveals the winner.


# Method
While making this program we will follow a workflow which will be like:
   - Accepting user input.
   - Generating random output.
   - Comparing the choices.
   - Declaring the winner.
Since it is a rock paper and scissor game, it requires input from the user in order to generate some end result.

The working of this program will have several functions and methods. Once it gets the input from the user it will compare the input with the input generated by the system. This system generated input will be random so that out of the rock, paper, and scissor it can give any one of them. Once it gets both the inputs, it will do the conditional rendering. The conditional rendering will provide the basis on which the winner is to be declared or no winner but draw.
